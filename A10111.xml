            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

greater length, I reſolued to reuiſe and frame out this expoſition vpon S. Paul to the Galathians, with Obſeruations, Queſtions, &amp; Motiues: The rather for the ſhortnes of the text, beſt fitting with my leaſureleſſe occaſions, and likewiſe for the waightineſſe of many matters either naturally ariſing, or incidently taken, and accordingly diſcourſed.</p>
            <p>Wherein to declare in what ſort I haue gone in &amp; out before that people &amp; their worſhipful neighbors repairing to them, and ioyning with them in this ſeruice for theſe many years together, albeit I haue much abridged, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where enlarged and altered, yet for the moſt part theſe READINGS may be called but the REMEMBRANCES of things, that haue paſſed amongſt the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and nowe are briefely ſet downe in this ſhort impresſion.</p>
            <p>And herein plainly to confes what I
<pb facs="tcp:1318:3"/>
think of this bookiſh humor of writing bookes: truely, in them that can write why ſhoulde they (as it is in the Poet) <hi>Periturae parcere chartae?</hi> They haue a gift &amp; a talent that way, &amp; why ſhould they hide it? For others, who may be better occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied, there is no reaſon they abuſe the Reader, &amp; peſter the world with vnpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable vanities.</p>
            <p>For my ſelfe the laſt of many, and for the reſt of greateſt ability, al our books are but entra<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ces to the book of books, vnto the ſacred Bible, &amp; book of God: which were it indeed deeply imprinted in the harts of al me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, I could eaſily haue ſpared this ſimple labor, and could and would haue wiſhed euen LVTHERS wiſh, vppon the ſame verie condition that he did: That al bookes els were in a faire light fiar.</p>
            <p>But men beeing men (God ſo orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring it) require &amp; neede humane helps,
<pb facs="tcp:1318:4"/>
and Maſter LVTHERS booke vpon this very Epiſtle, is a profitable writing, and full of comfort.</p>
            <p>Euerie man cannot readily vſe the Scripture ſtrait-way, euery man cannot at the firſt bluſh tell which Scripture is fitteſt for confirmation of this or that article in faith, which faireſt for exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in manners, which fulleſt for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of errors, &amp; therefore by prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching, by penning, by conference and by imprinting God hath prouided ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient aids as the times haue required, that men may looke and looke againe vpon things, examine the ſpirits, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare matters and cauſes, ruminate and chue the kud, meditate the ſtate of their ſaluation, and go the waies there-unto with a cleane and a clouen foot, that is, as ISICHIVS ſaith, with a wiſe, a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creet &amp; a diſtinguiſhing vnderſta<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ding.</p>

To the holie Citie? To his anceſters? To them that were Apoſtles before him? Nothing leſſe. He neither regarded the place, nor reſpected their perſons: but the mightie and merciful God that called him, and ſent him ſufficiently warranted, and he went accordingly about his calling.</p>

He was called negatiuely not of men nor by men: affirmatiuely by Chriſt, and by Chriſt alone, by an Heauenlie viſion, by a celeſtiall reuelation. Three yeares were betweene his firſt calling, and before his firſt iourneying to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> and fourteen before this his ſecond iourney. Shotte he al this while at random, ventured hee without a warrant, or knew he not what hee did, &amp; delt he at aduentures? No, by no meanes, no.

This was the matter of his conference and communication. 2. The perſons with whom he conferred, were the chiefe. 1.

               <p n="3">3 My third note was why <hi>Paul</hi> went again to <hi>Ieruſalem,</hi> prouoked by reuelatio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>: but to what end?

Which the rather came to paſſe, becauſe of ſlaunders raiſed vp, that <hi>Paul</hi> forſooth varied from the chiefe Apoſtles, that hee impeached the dignitie expreſly of circumciſion, and that he generally ſought the aboliſhment of ancient receaued rites and ceremonies ordained by God himſelfe: which when weake mindes heard, they were ſoone en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueigled with entiſing woords, and <hi>Pauls</hi> prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching became in vaine to them, and vnto them vnprofitable.</p>
               <p>Wherefore to declare that the reſt of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles with him and hee with them were of one vniforme iudgement, he taketh ſufficient witnes, vndertaketh the iourney, conferreth his doings, to the end to ſtop the mouthes of cauillers, and to the farther confirmation of the infirmer ſort, that his running might not be in vaine to them ward.

Of the former more in the fifth Chapter follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The ſpiritual bewitching, is ment here. they ſay, children are ſooneſt bewitched; we aer ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>childiſh in Gods matters, and therefore the ſooner deceiued, eſpecially if the deceiuer bee his crafts-maſter. A fine flatterer wilbee more in the bookes of a foole; than a perfect friend. To the weake eie the cleareſt and the trueſt light is moſt offenſiue, &amp; to the ſick of an ague, the beſt drinke is worſt: and as to children, and vnto weomen with-childe vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely fruite, or vnholſome foode ſeemeth better, than better meate, ſo wee ſee it in <hi>Adam,</hi> and in <hi>Adams</hi> children being in an ague and diſtempred with his fall, &amp; (as it were) with-child with their own fancies: affection miſleadeth them, and folly maketh vs prone to euery inconuenience, and in this ſiniſter conceit, and ouer-weening were the <hi>Galathians</hi> deceiued. And it being put in their heads that Gods Lawe would doe very wel with Chriſts Ghoſpell, and that woorkes iointly with faith would the rather iuſtifie &amp; ſaue, than faith in Chriſt alone, they were caried headlong into that moſt pernicious error, &amp; ſo become, 1. fools in their vnderſtanding, 2. Bewitched in opinion, 3. And diſobedient to the faith, cleane contrary to their education and training vp, contrary to their owne conuerſation in the Goſpel, contrary to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer ſufferings not at al, for the Law, but only for the faith in Chriſt alone. Was this no folly?</p>
               <p>They whoe had indured many ſtormes and

Except they were bewitched and out of their wittes, they could not posſibly bee ſo, ſo diſobedient, to fall from their ſpirituall comfort, and to become as groſſe as the old <hi>Iewes</hi> for their ceremonies, &amp; worſe than the <hi>Iewes</hi> as to dreame that any workes could ſaue, either without or yet with Chriſt, as to that purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Workes are duties to be doone, but when wee haue doone al, it is Chriſt that ſaueth: and workes do not iuſtifie. That is a fleſhly, a groſſe &amp; a fooliſh imagination. There is no ſpirit, no ſpiritual wiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome in it, and marke, marke with an attentiue eare, and with an intentiue eie what Saint <hi>Paul</hi> auerreth and ſaith, that they were fooles not to end as they beganne, beginning as they did, in Chriſt.</p>

                     <bibl>15</bibl> Brethren, (I ſpeake according to man) though it bee but a mans teſtament, when it is confirmed, no man doth abrogate or addeth thereto.</p>

               <p>There are three principal matters handled by

our Apoſtle in the reſidue of this chapter. 1. Firſt, that <hi>inuiolably</hi> the promiſe was ſo to be receiued, as it was deliuered. 2. Then <hi>in whom</hi> the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was made. 3. Thirdly when and at what time it was <hi>ſolemnly</hi> ordained.</p>
               <p>For the due reſpect of the promiſe to bee in ſenſe ſo conſtered, as it was ment by the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the promiſer, without adding or alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the Apoſtle condeſcendeth to the capacity of a common example in mans ordinarie experience. <hi>I ſpeake according to man.</hi> After the manner of men, taking the beſt way to be vnderſtood. <note place="margin">

                     <bibl>16</bibl> Now to Abraham and his ſeede were the promiſes made. He ſaith not, and to the ſeed as of many, but, And to thy ſeede, as of one which is Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>
                     <bibl>17</bibl> And this I ſay, that the couenant that was confirmed afore of god in reſpect of chriſt, the Law was foure hundred and thirty yeares after, cannot diſanul that it ſhuld make the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of none effect.</p>
                  <p>

Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſheweth that the roote of the bleſſing was neither in him nor in his al along deſcending naturally, but <hi>IN A SEEDE,</hi> not in ſeedes, as in many, nor in any, but onely in the <hi>promiſed
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:1318:68"/>
ſeede,</hi> and this ſeede hee expreſſy meaneth to bee Chriſt: <hi>To thy ſeede as of one which is Chriſt:</hi> the ſeede of the woman, the ſeede of ſeedes, the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual <hi>Iſaack,</hi> the ſeede of <hi>Abraham,</hi> the author of life, the bound of al the promiſes which is Chriſt perfourmed. And ſuch as is the performance, ſuch was the promiſe. Saint <hi>Paul</hi> telleth vs this ſeede was but one, for Chriſt is but one. Wherefore in the waie of ſaluation, wee repaire neither to <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> nor to <hi>Abrahams</hi> race, much leſſe to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men or meanes, but onely to the promiſe, which had his accompliſhment fully and wholy in Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In few, out of the former reſpectes I gather theſe ſhort inferences and concluſions: 1. The bleſſing is of promiſe, <hi>
                     <hi>ergo</hi>
                  </hi> free, and not of deedes foregoing or foreſeene. 2. The bleſſing was a free gift to <hi>Abraham, <hi>ergo</hi>
                  </hi> moſt free. 3. The bleſſing was in one certaine ſeed, <hi>
                     <hi>ergo</hi>
                  </hi> not in many. 4. And in one alone, <hi>
                     <hi>ergo</hi>
                  </hi> not in any thing elſe, and this one was Chriſt accordingly perfourmed, as hee was firſt promiſed to bee the ſole and only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour al-ſufficient of all that truſt in him to bee ſaued.</p>
               <p n="1">1 Yet ouer and aboue the former conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the obſeruation of the time when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe was granted to <hi>Abraham</hi> maketh the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter quite out of doubt touching the freeneſſe of the promiſe.</p>
               <p>This couenant of the promiſe was made, and

                     <hi>Gods promiſes are infallibly conſtant.</hi>
                  </note> but God is not as man that he can riſe and ſit, eb and flow, neither wil he repent, but where he promiſeth, and as hee freely promiſed, ſo will hee not after and change his promiſes.</p>
               <p>This promiſe and couenant was made four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teene hundred and thirty yeares before the Lawe was made in mount <hi>Horeb.</hi> It was made, &amp; ſhal it not ſtand? <note place="margin">

God is not contrarie to himſelfe either in the eſſence and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his being, or in order or tenor of his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and ſayinges. His promiſe is a promiſe, and as it was free at firſt in the promiſe, ſo is it free in the perfourmance, free then, and free now, and for euer free. For Gods after-doinges doe not thwart or contrarie his former deedes, which muſt needs be if Righteouſnes ſhould come by the Law.</p>

in this meaning becommeth deſeruice-able to force vs to Chriſt, and being nowe in Chriſt, our dutifull obedience proceedeth of faith and truſt in his mercy, not vpon a performance of his Lawe, which if we could and did performe, Chriſt might be excluded.

               <p>
                  <hi>Paul</hi> omitteth none, and continueth all means, neither bands or beuty, foule or faile, neither oyle nor vineger. <hi>O yee fooliſh Galathians, &amp;c.</hi> This was a rough ſpeech, this was vineger. <hi>Brethren I beſeech you:</hi> This is a faire entreaty and a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying oyle.

               <p>And in this affection he requeſteth <hi>them to be as he was,</hi> for <hi>he was as they were.</hi> The requeſt is moſt reaſonable, that they ſhoulde bee as <hi>Paul</hi> was. For <hi>Paul</hi> was right, and they were ſeduced. And yet <hi>Pauls</hi> reaſon <hi>for that he was as they were,</hi> may ſeeme no true cauſe. For indeede <hi>Paul</hi> was not as they were. Yet ſo he ſaith and argueth <hi>For I am as you are.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The anſwere is eaſie and ready. <hi>Paul</hi> was in kindneſſe to them, as they were to them-ſelues: but in the ſyncerity of trueth <hi>Paul</hi> requireth they ſhould be as hee was, which now they were not. For then what need he deſire them to be that they
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:1318:93"/>
were already? Wherefore in kindnes he was as they; in acknowledging the truth, they were once as he, but were not now as once they were, and as now <hi>Paul</hi> was.</p>
               <p>But leaſt <hi>Paul</hi> might hee thought to reproue them or thus to requeſt them vpon ſome priuate quarrel and offence, giuen or taken, and thereby deſirous to intimat that they were out of the way, with a greedy and haſty humor finding fault euen where no fault was, vnder a colorable kindneſſe, hee proteſteth that they neuer hurt him. Naie to ſhew their kindnes to him ward mutually, he alſo ſpeaketh directly of their perſons, how ſometimes they were affected toward him, as he was yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them.</p>
               <p>And ſpeaking of them, he agniſeth 1. How they reuerenced his miniſtery, 2. How they loued his perſon, and 3. Hee expoſtulateth and reproueth them that they were eſtranged without iuſt occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>Paul</hi> beginneth with their vertues howe they loued and reuerenced him and imbraced the truth, and thereby ſheweth plainly that hee goeth to woork, and dealeth with them vpon no malice. For they loued him, and hee loued them, and for loue hee was bolde to reproue them. <note place="margin">

               <p>For as in an awger or a perſer the point doeth pierſe, yet the handle and the haſt helpeth not a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle,
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:1318:94"/>
ſo in perſuading or diſſuading, when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is (as it were) hatred with loue, and handled with a good liking on both parts, it pierſeth the better, and therby taketh an eaſier forth, force and effect.</p>

                  </note> The <hi>mixt Non-reſident</hi> hath pluralities of liuings, and liueth wel in his common conuerſation, and preacheth, happily v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon one of them, and keepeth the better houſe there, where hee liueth, by reaſon of his other liuings.</p>
               <p>That ſuch a one keepeth the bigger houſe, I graunt, but that hee keepeth the better, if better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes be rightly conceiued, I vetterly deny. For that is ſyncere and good that is not mixt with euil, and he that robbeth one to pay, or to gratifie another with fuller meaſure, is no vpright dealer. The husband-man may proine off ſome bowes, that ſome others may grow the better and the bigger, but the caſe is diuerſe, &amp; euen like vnto the vnkind father that will ſtarue ſome of his children, to feed one of them the fatter: &amp; like the vnnaturall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that will kill the reſt of her children hauing many, to make one the greater heire and iollier-fellow.</p>
               <p>It were farre better that there were greater regard taken in this behalfe. But remedy this, and remedy all: and remedy not this, and I ſtand in doubt, I fear leaſt the ſemynary and ſeed-men

               <p>The mothers of <hi>Abrahams</hi> children were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers, and therefore the one was free, and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther bond.

                  <hi>His people and his Church,</hi> in ſenſe and ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification is al one. If God had no people, he had no Church. But he had reiected and caſt off that his people, where was then his Church.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle aunſwereth himſelfe one way for the future time by <hi>receauing in of the Gentiles,</hi> and another way for the preſent time, that albeit the <hi>Iewes</hi> were caſt off, yet God had a Church.

On a day I was to make an Oration before the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour or Gouernour, therein I tooke not a little pains to depaint out his praiſes, therby entending to purchaſe ſome fauour and credite, and opinion of credit with his honour.</p>
               <p>But as I was in the way, and while my head
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:1318:140"/>
was ful, and my hart heauy, and I as it were with child, til this wind were vented, and I deliuered of that, which I had conceaued, I met a beggerly drunke<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> rogue, that ſang ful merily, and was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueilous excesſiue pleaſaunt. I ſtoode and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the man, and compared his ſtate. At laſt I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to reaſon with my companions, that it went far better with this fellow, than it fared with me, by how much mirth is better than ſorrow, a glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome hart, than a heauy ſoule: and albeit it might be ſaid that the ioy I might conceaue of my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning were to be preferred, verily I muſt confeſſe where that fault ſecretly wringeth, alas my lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, knowledge and ſtudy, is more bent to pleaſe, than to profit, to ſpeak to the eare, than to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of men. And this is a very vanity.</p>
               <p>And though the druncken mans mirth may ſeeme more vile than a fancy of vaine glory, yet it is not ſo. For to glory, but not in the Lord, is the greateſt ſhame. To ſeeke to bee great, but not in Chriſt, is the weightieſt ſinne. To ſtriue for honor in the kingdom of humility, is worſe than a drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kennes.</p>

Some, by waters think are ſignified the ſea, that on the very Sea, a man ſhould not ſtick to venter his goods, and euen to ſhip them ouer to farre countries, to doe them good, and in the ſight of God this trafique will be a very acceptable trade, and in the ende to thee ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie profitable.

Muſt I care for the lilly of the field, and not for the lilly in my garden? Or muſt I feed the rauen, and ſtarue the innocent and ſimple Doue?

                  </note> Schoole-men in ſteede of diuiding the various ſignifications of this word (Grace) they break it into ſhiuers, and beat it into pouder, and neuer make an end.</p>
               <p>In few and generally: <hi>Grace</hi> is no way <hi>Grace</hi> that is not euery way gratiouſly graunted and freely giuen: and it may bee offered, where it may be refuſed. But where God wil beſtow it, it ſhalbe receaued.</p>

                  </note>In ſpecial, firſt the Grace of God is the fauor of the father. 2. The Grace of the ſpirit is the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the holy Ghoſt. 3. The grace of Chriſt is the merit of the ſonne and the myſtery of his pasſion. And theſe three go al together, and are neuer aſunder.</p>
               <p>And theſe three, brethren, beeing thoroughlie known and beleeued and laid to hart, in a full and certain aſſuraunce of <hi>the ſpirit,</hi> &amp; not ſwimming in the quick conceat of an imagining head, and gliding vp and down in a ſlippery tongue, but felt in the ſoule, and ſetled by faith, in the inward fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ition of the ſecret parts, what comfort work they not? They quiet the conſcience, they pacifie the mind, they order the whole tenour of a Chriſtian conuerſation in euery good way. The feare of the Law, hath not theſe effectes. And therefore <hi>Paul</hi> eſpecially wiſheth the <hi>Galathians</hi> the Grace of Chriſt.</p>
